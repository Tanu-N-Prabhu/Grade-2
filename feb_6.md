## Reading Text

### *The Lost Blue Pencil*

Sam had a blue pencil. It was his favorite pencil because it made bright, neat lines. One morning at school, Sam opened his pencil case and the blue pencil was gone.

Sam looked under his desk and inside his backpack. He asked his friend Maya if she had seen it. Maya shook her head and helped Sam look around the classroom.

After recess, Sam saw something blue near the art shelf. It was his blue pencil! It had rolled under the table. Sam felt happy and thanked Maya for helping him. He put the pencil safely back in his pencil case.
